Dead simple training code for AI Platform workshop


## What is it?
This repo holds the code to be used in the [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wE6j_lBQcCM_ba_4n-aujDIvkcRRUqNA) that demonstrates how to train a machine learning model with TensorFlow by using [AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/), a serverless service by Google Cloud Platform for training and batch or online prediction. As this is a paid service, you may want to use [price calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/) to estimate how much does your workload cost.
## How to run
[Click here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wE6j_lBQcCM_ba_4n-aujDIvkcRRUqNA) to open the associated notebook in Google Colab, and follow the code and explanations.
